This is rnaediting 0.0.2.1  (software for A-I calling On RNA)

Usage:

   rnaediting-0.0.2.1 EXAMPLE.yaml

Arguments:

  EXAMPLE.yaml is a text file  with 3 arguments specified as key/values as below

  The 3 required arguments are: The BAM file, the reference genome, and a list of known SNPs to filter out. 

  # This is a BAM file of your reads aligned to the genome. 
  # You can generate this file using any short read aligner, 
  # and it does not need to be sorted (the pipeline will split + sort things for you). 
  # Our example.bam is a downsampled BAM file containing the first 10,000 lines (9,983 reads) of a real sample.
  input_bam:
    class: File
    path: example.bam

  # This describes the reference genome in FASTA format (used in the mpileup step), 
  # which specifies the reference for which variant reads are compared against. 
  # The included reference is the first chromosome of a ce11 assembly.
  reference:
    class: File
    path: ce11.chrI.fa

  # This file contains a list of known SNPs which will be filtered from the list of candidate editing sites. 
  # The example file contains just one SNP in BED3 format (0-based, half-open), 
  # which can be used to remove sites that we know aren't editing sites, but are known SNPs.
  known_snp:
    class: File
    path: knownSNPs.bed

Template and example:

   A folder called example has been created in the current directory.
   It includes example data and a parameter file tp process them with rnaediting-0.0.1.2

   A template argument file named TEMPLATE.yaml has been copied into your curremnt directory.
   You can rename that file, edit the values to reflect your data, run it with rnaediting-0.0.1.2
